# JMP_Cover_Letter
This repository contains files to replicate a cover letter template with the names of different institutions.

The objective is to take a cover letter template (Cover_Template.tex) and generate multiple pdf files with the information of institutions and positions to which one wants to apply. Each pdf file is named according to and institution/position.

The program runs in Matlab. It takes two inputs:

  1) Cover_Template.tex
  2) Job_Postings.csv

The output is a set of pdf files.
